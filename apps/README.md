# MongoDB GenAI Applications Showcase

This directory contains a collection of JavaScript and Python applications demonstrating how to use MongoDB in GenAI applications. Each application showcases different aspects of MongoDB's capabilities in AI/ML contexts.

## Applications

### 1. Graph RAG Demo
A demonstration of how to leverage MongoDB's capabilities to create and manipulate graph representations using both Python and Node.js. This application showcases:
- Graph-based Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)
- Integration with OpenAI for embeddings
- MongoDB's graph capabilities
- Hybrid implementation using Python and Node.js

### 2. Local RAG PDF
A demonstration of local RAG implementation using MongoDB and PDF processing.

### 3. Lyric Semantic Search
A semantic search service built with Spring AI and MongoDB Atlas. Features:
- Spring AI framework integration
- MongoDB Atlas Vector Search implementation
- Semantic search capabilities for song lyrics
- Metadata filtering support
- Built with Java and Spring Boot

### 4. MongoMP (MongoDB Music Platform)
A cutting-edge music streaming platform leveraging MongoDB and Next.js. Features:
- AI-powered song recommendations using MongoDB's vector search
- Advanced search functionality
- Real-time play count and last played tracking
- Playlist creation and management

- Document loading and semantic querying capabilities

### 7. Voice OpenAI MongoDB Rentals Agent
A voice interaction agent for real estate listings powered by MongoDB vector search and OpenAI. Features:
- Real-time voice interaction
- MongoDB Atlas Vector Search integration
- OpenAI real-time API integration
- Semantic property search
- Built with Python, Flask, and MongoDB

## Common Technologies

Most applications in this showcase utilize:
- **MongoDB Atlas**: For database operations and vector search capabilities
- **Vector Search**: For semantic similarity searches and AI-powered features
- **OpenAI Integration**: For generating embeddings and processing natural language
- **Modern Web Frameworks**: Including Next.js, Spring Boot, and Flask
- **RAG (Retrieval Augmented Generation)**: For enhanced AI responses using stored knowledge

## Getting Started

Each application has its own README with specific setup instructions. Generally, you'll need:
1. A MongoDB Atlas account with a cluster running MongoDB 6.0+ or 7.0+
2. OpenAI API credentials
3. Appropriate runtime environment (Node.js, Python, or Java) based on the application
4. Required dependencies as specified in each application's documentation
